  title: Understanding biological systems with chemometrics
  description: My name is Francesc Puig-Castellví and I am a postdoctoral researcher
    at European Genomic Institute for Diabetes in Lille, France. My long-term research
    is focused on deciphering how microbiomes respond to perturbations of any kind.
  content: 'To do so, I collect omics data representative of these microbiomes and
    I analyze them with chemometrics (the science of extracting information from chemical
    systems by data-driven means). Aiming to obtain the maximum relevant information
    from the data, l also develop my own data analysis tools and workflows. I am particularly
    interested in the development of methods for the analysis of metabolomics data,
    and of methods capable to combine and integrate data from different sources (multi-omics
    data analysis). '

  title: THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
  content: I am interested in the study of microbial communities. I investigate the
    human gut microbiome to understand how it interacts with our bodies and, in consequence,
    with our health.</br> I have also explored the microbiome from anaerobic digesters,
    which are big tanks where waste is converted into biogas by microorganisms living
    under anaerobic conditions. In this project, I looked at how the microorganisms
    in the digesters were affected by perturbations (i.e. change of temperature, presence
    of a microbial growth inhibitor) and how this translated to a change in the digesters’
    biogas production.</br> I am keen on inspecting other systems as well. During
    my research life, I have worked with cultures of single microbial species, fish,
    and serum and urine from human. Last, I have even investigated non-biological
    systems. For example, I have studied how molecules in a chemical mixture interacted
    differently among them on basis to the mixture’s conditions (i.e. the effect of
    the ionic strength, pH,…).

  title: THE DATA
  content: In my work, I always try to use data as varied as possible. I have invsetigated data obtained with very different analytical platforms, mainly multivariate data (NMR spectroscopy, HPLC-MS, GC-MS, 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, NIR hyperspectral imaging, 3D EEM fluorescence) but also univariate (pH, temperature, DOC, COD, NH4 concentration…). Most of the data I used was acquired by myself, except for some collaboration studies.
